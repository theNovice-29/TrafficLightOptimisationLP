Optimization of Urban Traffic Flow Using Linear Programming

This repository provides Python implementations for optimizing traffic light timing at urban intersections using linear programming to reduce congestion and improve traffic throughput. The program uses the linprog function from SciPy, along with NumPy for numerical calculations and Matplotlib for visualization of the optimized traffic light durations.

Features:
Traffic Optimization: Calculate and visualize optimized traffic light timings to minimize vehicle waiting times.
Linear Programming Model: Utilizes linear programming techniques to handle multiple constraints and objectives efficiently.
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, scipy
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy scipy
How to Run:
Command Line:
bash
Copy code
python TrafficOptimization.py
IDE:
Import the files into your IDE, configure the Python interpreter, and run TrafficOptimization.py.
Expected Output:
The program outputs the optimized durations for traffic lights across various intersections, accompanied by visualizations of the traffic management improvements.
