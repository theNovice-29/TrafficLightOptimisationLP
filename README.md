# Optimization of Urban Traffic Flow Using Linear Programming

# Overview
This README provides instructions on how to compile and run python program that implement linear programming algorithm using linprog, a library of SciPY and uses other libraries of Python like NumPy and MatplotLib for Optimization of Urban Traffic Flow Using Linear Programming. The provided Python codes include a code for calculating optimsed waiting time for traffic lights and its visualization

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Libraries such as NumPy for numerical calculations, and SciPy for optimization. These can be installed via pip:
pip install numpy scipy

An IDE like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or a simple text editor.
Basic understanding of running Python scripts from the command line or an IDE.


Files inside source code folder -> Source Codes folder

TrafficOptimization.py

How to Run the Codes
Using Command Line
Open the terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.


# To run the Traffic Optimization Program:
python TrafficOptimization.py

# Using an IDE
Open your preferred IDE and set up a Python project.
Import the Python files into the project.
Ensure that Python interpreter is properly configured in your IDE.
Run the TrafficOptimization.py script from the IDE.

# Expected Output
Upon execution, the program will display the optimized durations of traffic lights at various intersections to minimize vehicle waiting times. The output also includes visualization for detailed traffic light timing plans for each intersection and the overall improvement in traffic throughput.
